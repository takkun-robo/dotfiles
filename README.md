This repository is a space for my config files.

~~This repository name "musical-train" is recommended by github.~~ 

~~i like this name, but i think this name is misleadable name.~~

i renamed this reposiroty 'musical-train' to 'dotfiles' because that was not easy to understand what is this repository.

~~to me in future: i think if this repo's name is 'musical-muscle' , that is funny. would you like to add an musical-muscle ascii art to this readme?~~
